# MSc Thesis: Audio-Visual Interaction Effects on the Rendering and Perception of Shimmer

This repository contains code as well as the experiment samples used in the user study experiment of this project.<br /><br />
The file "Shimmer User Study.zip" is a Unity project for the user study experiment.<br />
The file "Shimmer.zip" is a Unity project used for producing the visual stimuli.<br />
The file "Frequency Analysis and Audio Generation.ipynb" performs DIC on the renderings, generates audio stimuli, and combines the results with the visuals to produce experiment samples.<br />
The file "Data Analysis.ipynb" contains functions used for the statistical analysis for the experiment results.<br />
<br />
Note that the background oriented schlieren image sequences used for DIC was not uploaded due to file size constraints. They can be generated by following the procedures described in the project report. <br />
